# AndroidJavaLocationPermission
Project for "Android Studio" runtime location permission example completed and working, you are not able to start the app until you allow!

The project implements a workaround for the problem of runtime permissions and the option ‘Never ask again’ because you can't use the application without to allowing location permission.

If the user rejects the location permission or set option ‘Never ask again’ takes the user to the application settings when starting it and can't start the if the location permission is not allowed.
